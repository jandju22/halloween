                <p>Frankenstein's Monster - often called "The Monster", "The Creation" or incorrectly called just "Frankenstein" - is the legendary creature created by Victor Frankenstein in Mary Shelley's classic horror tale. In the decades since Shelley's original novel, the monster has gone down in history as one of the most iconic horror fiction characters of all time, appearing in numerous media formats.</p>

                        <p>Victor Frankenstein builds the creature in his laboratory through an ambiguously described scientific method consisting of chemistry (from his time as a student at University of Ingolstadt) and alchemy (largely based on the writings of Paracelsus, Albertus Magnus, and Cornelius Agrippa). The creature horrifies Frankenstein, and the scientist immediately disavows the experiment. Abandoned, frightened, and completely unaware of his own identity, the monster wanders through the wilderness searching for kindness and acceptance. He finds brief solace in a woodshed beside a remote cottage inhabited by a family of peasants, the DeLaceys. Eavesdropping on the family's conversation, the creature familiarizes himself with their lives and comes to regard them as his own family, referring to them as his 'protectors'. He learns to speak by listening to the family teach French, their native language, to an Arabian daughter-in-law, and the creature becomes eloquent, educated, and well-mannered in a short time.</p>
